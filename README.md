# Employee Directory
Employee Directory is a program to demonstrate a Binary Search Tree. This allows us to modify, add, lookup, and delete data from a node, as well as choose to look up records pre-order, in-order, or post-order.

This program uses 2 classes:
- Node: This is holding the code for a single node in the Binary Search Tree.
- Dictionary: This is responsible for managing the Binary Search Tree and providing operations to add, delete, modify, and lookup records in the dictionary.

In this way we are able to create a Binary Search Tree to link nodes and recall data in different orders depending on how we would like to see the data.

Thank you for checking out my program,
